#Lok's web page 
===
## Introduction
This is my second version of my personal website. I model myself as a photographer and the website is to showcase the photos I have taken over the years.

## Updates
Compare to my first version, I used JQuery to add on the toggle proerties on my navbar, and the colour is changed.

## Features to be added
The gallery is to be added on an onclick method to let users have a closer look on the photos.
